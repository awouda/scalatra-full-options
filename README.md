Scalatra example project with:

- twitter bootstrap
- Squeryl integration (uses H2 db for now)
- seperated into 2 modules, i.e. this is a SBT Multibuild project
- added IntelliJ support (run gen-idea in root project)
- added some basic support for I18N

Run sbt in root project to compile / test all
Run sbt in scalatra-project to seperately run container:start, before you do run in the domain-project 'publish-local'


Remark: it works, but 'architecture/design-wise' far from done!
